# Hello-world
testing with CS50 AP course 

Hi, my name is Hanan.

Believe it or not, I want to learn coding to win in a local competition.
I hope I'll win the first place
If I didn't have any chance of winning then I'm glad that I'm having this experience
and I hope I'll find a better opportunity soon.
